Password for next level flawfully stored in an easily readable file named "readme", then accessed with the cat command.

user: bandit1
pass: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
Due to naming a file with a single dash (-), which conflicts with typical command-line options, I was able to exploit this by specifying the file's path using ./ to differentiate it from command options. 
By running the command cat ./- I bypassed the conflict and was able to read the contents of the file.

pass: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
Due to the flaw of using spaces in a file name, which can cause the shell to misinterpret the file name as separate arguments, I was able to obatin the password by escaping the spaces with a backslash.
Running "cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename" I was able to view the file's contents.

user: bandit3
pass: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
Due to the flaw of hiding the file name by starting it with "...", I was able to exploit this level by using the ls -a command. After identifying the hidden file named ...Hiding-From-You, I used the cat command to read its contents
